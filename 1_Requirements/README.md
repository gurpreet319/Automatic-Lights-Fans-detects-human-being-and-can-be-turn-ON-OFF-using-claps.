# Requirements

## High Level Requirement
1. Light Should be turned on when person enters the room if Sun is up.
2. Claps system works only when person claps twice.
3. Lights should tunred OFF when person leaves

## Low Level Requirements
1. Delay between consectuive slaps should be minimum
2. Proper calibration of all the sensors
3. Other Noises should not turn on the clap system.
4. Mic should be placed in adequate place.

## Hardware Requirements
1. IC CD4017- Decade Counter
2. IC 347 - Comparator
3. T-Flip Flop
4. 2 to 1 Mux
5. Photo Diode Sensor
6. Infrared Sensor
7. Condensor Mic
8. Photo Resistor
9. IC - 7408 - AND Gate


## Software Requirements
(Only for Lab simulation)
1. VHDL
2. MODELSIM Simulator


## Cost 

This device is built using electronic components which are easily available in market and affordable.

# SWOT Analysis

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

This device helps the consumer by reducing their electric bill and helps the child by avoiding the direct contact with electrical switches.

## What:

A device which turns On light when a person enters and it is Dark outside. This whole device overrides by clap System.

## When:
This device ensures that lights are OFF when they are not in use.

## Where:

It can be used in front of the doors in public washrooms or at home.

## How:

WHen person enters, it detects by IR sensor which is placed at door and photo resistor checks whether it's day or night. If it day, the light will turn OFF or else Lights will be turn ON. If lights are On and person who is inside, wants to turn OFF, then 2 consecutive claps with minimal delay will turn OFF the switch.
